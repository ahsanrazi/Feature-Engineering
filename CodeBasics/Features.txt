-> What are Features?

    -> In the context of machine learning, a feature (also known as a variable or attribute) is an individual -> measurable property of a data point that is used as input for a machine learning algorithm. 
    -> Features can be numerical, categorical, or text-based.

    -> For Example: We are doing a Property Price Prediction Problem, this is one of the classical problems
    -> in Machine Learning.
    -> Here we are trying to predict Price of a home using Machine Learning based on certain factors: Area,
    -> Facilities, How old is the home, Location.
    -> These Factors are called Features.
    -> These are the Factors on which the target variable such as Price is determined.

    -> For Example: We are tryinmg to classify images Dogs vs Cats.
    -> As we are walking on the road and we saw cats and dogs how can we identify this is cat or this is dogs
    -> we do feature detection in our brains. In our brain there are Neurons and these units trying to detect 
    -> different features like: Nose, Eyes, Ears. Based on these features we can identify either it is a Cat 
    -> or a Dog
    -> Any this related to images is simply solved by CNN.
